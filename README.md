# ClojureScript Template

See [this write-up][] for an in-depth guide.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i
npm run server        # start shadow-cljs server
```

Then, in a different shell process:

- `npm run server:repl` to start the server repl
- `npm run app:compile` to compile a dev build once
- `npm run app:release` to compile a production build
- `npm run app:watch`   to start a dev watch
- `npm run app:repl`    to connect to ClojureScript REPL
